# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Search Algorithms
#### Linear Search - a method of searching which inspects each element within a list until it found the one that it is searching for.
#### Binary Search- a more efficient method compared to linear, as it repeatedly divides a portion until it matches with the element it is looking for.

## Linked List
#### Singly Linked List - Nodes face only on One direction. (one way) ->
#### Doubly Linked List - Nodes can face on two directions. (two way) <- ->

## Stack and Queues
#### Stack - Last In First Out
#####    Stack using Queues
#####    Queues Using Stack
#### Queues - First In First Out

## Trees
#### Binary Search Tree
#### Transversals
##### Level Order - transverses based on the level of the tree
##### Preorder - print left right
##### Inorder - left print right 
##### Postorder - left right print
