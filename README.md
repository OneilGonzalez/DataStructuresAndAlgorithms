# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Search Algorithms
### Linear Search - a method of searching which inspects each element within a list until it found the one that it is searching for.
### Binary Search- a more efficient method compared to linear, as it repeatedly divides a portion until it matches with the element it is looking for.
